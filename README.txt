1. Create a vagrant vm and ssh into it
2. cd to /vagrant
2. Run vmsetup.sh twice
3. Run setupVirtualenv.sh twice
4. Edit config.py for this project
5. Run appSetup.py
6. Create templates for main.html, header.html, and footer.html
7. Setup your git repo, and push initial commit
8. Setup ElasticBeanstalk environment with a MySQL db deploy intial commit
9. Configure aws security groups and add a inbound rule to allow traffic from your ip

At this point you will have a framework for a Flask-SQLAlchemy app setup for Oauth.
Customize to suit your purposes.  I will be updating this repo as I improve.
